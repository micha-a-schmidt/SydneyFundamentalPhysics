abstract: "We propose that neutrino Dirac masses can be generated through scotogenic scenario while violating lepton number by 4 units by extending the standard model to have anomaly free B-L which is spontaneously broken to residual Z4 symmetry. Z4 symmetry ensures the Dirac nature of neutrinos and simultaneously stabilizes dark matter. Although neutrinoless double beta decay is exactly absent, this model predicts nonzero neutrinoless quadruple beta decay (0nu4beta). It is shown that 0nu4beta can be enhanced thanks to the introduction of new scalar field without affecting tiny neutrino masses and the relic density of dark matter. We perform numerical analysis for 0nu4beta, dark matter and direct detection by imposing cosmological, collider and theoretical constraints."
