The past years have seen impressive progress in our understanding of the physics at very large
and very short distances. At large distances the Î›CDM model is consistent with numerous ob-
servations of our Universe. Cosmological precision data, such as the latest measurements of the
cosmic microwave background anisotropies by Planck, have determined its free parameters at
the percent level. At short distances the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics successfully
describes a wide range of phenomena with high precision. For example the anomalous magnetic
moment of the electron agrees with experiment to better than 12 significant figures. Despite the
success of these two models, several open questions remain:

* What is the origin of neutrino masses?
* Why are there three generations of matter?
* Is there an explanation for the large hierarchy among the fermion masses?
* What is dark matter?
* Why is there more matter than anti-matter?
* What is the origin of dark energy?
* What is the underlying theory of dark energy? 
* Which scalar field drives inflation?
